## A Systematic approach for Managing Government Schemes in Rural Areas of India
The schemes have cover a wide range of facilities, ranging from education, pensions and employment to subsidized items like LPG connections. All of these services are linked through an electronic system where a "Civil Supplies ID" is linked to your Aadhar Database (Aadhar is the citizen database where citizens are identified by their bio metric IDs, viz. fingerprint and eye retina). In order to distribute these supplies fairly, there are certain limitations on what benefits one person or family can avail. In this project, we generated a random data of all the tables. This data is not related to actual citizen data. This project is only for academic purpose only.
